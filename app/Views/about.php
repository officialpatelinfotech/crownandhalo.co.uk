        <h2 class="brand-serif" style="margin-top:8px; font-size:20px; color:var(--text);">How Clare Heaffey Turned Her Own Bridal Challenge Into a Gift for Every Woman</h2>

        <p class="mt-4"><b>Crown &amp; Halo was born from the heart of its founder, Clare Heaffey — a woman who understands that love has no age, no timeline, and no rules. At 60 years old, while preparing for her second wedding, Clare expected to find a dress that felt elegant, magical, and true to her story. Instead, she faced something many brides know too well:</b></p>

        <ul class="feature-sub" style="list-style-type: none;">
          <li>❌ Overpriced gowns</li>
          <li>❌ Limited choices</li>
          <li>❌ Designs that didn’t reflect her style or confidence</li>
          <li>❌ Pressure to spend thousands on a dress worn once</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Clare knew she deserved a gown that made her feel beautiful. Not youthful. Not perfect. Just beautiful.</p>

        <div class="about-hero-image" aria-hidden="false">
          <img src="<?= base_url('assets/attractive-bridesmaids-dressed-pale-pink-fashionable-dresses-with-tender-bouquets-made-pink-roses-are-smiling.jpg') ?>" alt="Clare Heaffey, founder of Crown &amp; Halo">
        </div>

        <h3 class="brand-serif mt-4">A Spark That Became a Mission</h3>
        <p>Standing in a fitting room, Clare had an epiphany:</p>
        <p class="feature-sub"><em>If she was struggling to find a beautiful, affordable dress at 60… how many other women were facing the same challenge?</em></p>

        <p>This moment became the spark that later grew into Crown &amp; Halo Dress Hire — a place where every bride, regardless of age, size, or budget, can feel extraordinary.</p>

        <blockquote style="border-left:4px solid var(--accent); padding:12px 16px; background:#FBF8F6;">
          “Every wedding is a fairytale — every bride deserves to feel like she belongs in hers.” — Clare
        </blockquote>

        <p><b>Driven by this belief, Clare set out to create a luxury-yet-affordable alternative to bridal shopping. Her vision was simple:</b></p>
        <ul class="feature-sub" style="list-style-type: none;">
          <li>✨ Designer-inspired gowns without designer price tags</li>
          <li>✨ A sustainable approach to bridal fashion</li>
          <li>✨ Beautiful, high-quality dresses available to every woman</li>
          <li>✨ A choice — one that most bridal shops don’t offer</li>
          <li>✨ A magical experience that doesn’t depend on your bank balance</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For Clare, this isn’t just a business. It’s a way of making sure no woman ever feels she must settle for less due to price, pressure, or age.</p>

        <h3 class="brand-serif mt-4">Transforming Dreams Into Moments That Last a Lifetime</h3>
        <p class="feature-sub">Crown &amp; Halo is Clare’s gift to today’s brides — especially those navigating rising costs, financial challenges, and a fashion world that often forgets real people and real budgets.</p>

        <p class="mb-0"><b>Her mission is to:</b></p>
        <ul class="feature-sub" style="list-style-type: none;">
          <li>🌿 Make sustainable bridal wear more accessible</li>
          <li>💍 Offer gown hire options that feel luxurious and special</li>
          <li>👗 Give women the power to choose elegance without overspending</li>
          <li>✨ Help brides create unforgettable memories, wrapped in confidence, joy, and beauty</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mt-3">Because every bride — whether she is 25, 35, 45, 60 or beyond — deserves that moment when she looks in the mirror and feels: <strong>“This is my story. This is my fairytale.”</strong></p>

        <h3 class="brand-serif mt-4">A New Chapter For Brides Everywhere</h3>
        <p>Crown &amp; Halo is now one of Peterborough’s most exciting options for affordable wedding dress hire, evening gown hire, and designer-inspired occasion wear — all thanks to one woman who dared to ask:</p>

        <p class="feature-sub"><em>“What if beautiful didn’t have to be expensive?”</em></p>

        <p>Clare found the answer. And now she shares it with every bride who walks through our doors.</p>
